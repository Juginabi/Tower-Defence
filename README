all gamelogic happens and is completely separate from rendering.

>>>>>>> experimental

v0.0.6
- Work has began with sfml renderwindow testing.
- Currently renderwindow opens and left mouse places tower and right mouse enemy
- No GFX yet. Logic still works. Towers acquire targets and enemies die. No one moves though.
- Gonna fine tune gamelogic more before starting any visual presentation over OGL.
- Soon propably moving to beta branch so master can be kept more stable with progression.

v0.0.5
- Removed SDL and introduced Simple and Fast Multimedia Library - SFML
- sf::Clock() now keeps track of frametimes
-> gameloop now works realtime
-> Framerate can be adjusted
-> towerEntity now reloads ammunition for two seconds after every shot.

v0.0.3
- cMapper class
-> Is singleton
-> stores all created entities. (atleast that is the plan)
TODO
- Integrate cMapper with global update.

v0.0.2
------
- Cmake integration

v0.0.1
------
- Game entities
- Basic datamodel building
